What is the difference between splice and slice in JavaScript ?

The splice() method adds/removes items to/from an array, and it returns the
item(s) removed.

The splice() method changes the original array, that means mutable.

Syntax: array.splice(index, howmany, item1, item2....itemn)

The slice() method returns the selected elements from an array, as a new array
object.

The slice() method selects the elements starting at the given start argument,
and ends at, but does not include, the given end argument.

The slice() method does not change the original array, that means immutable.
